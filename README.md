# DataStax_Cassandra_Intro_workout
Used Cassandra for the first time, and here is what i made out of it - Student Marks DB

I have always had the difficulty of searching my marks through the list provided by my Institute
So i got an idea of using the DataBase provided by Cassandra after attending my first ever DBMS session with DataStax
Thanks A Lot for Giving the Opportunity DataStax!!! :)
